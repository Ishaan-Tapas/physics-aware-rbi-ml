# Physics-Aware Risk-Based Inspection (RBI)

This repository demonstrates a physics-guided machine learning workflow
for risk-based inspection (RBI) of pressure vessels.

The focus is on combining engineering-based degradation logic with
data-driven failure probability models and explainability techniques
to support inspection and risk assessment decisions.

All data used in this repository is synthetic and included only to
demonstrate the workflow.
